A brief explanation of the technologies (Node modules, Express middleware etc) used.
A couple of paragraphs detailing the general approach you took.
Notes on any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome.
Installation instructions for any dependencies.


#User Stories


A link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
A link to your ERD - what data models does your app use?
#Wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application.
